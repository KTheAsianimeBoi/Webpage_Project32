        <h1> The Advantages </h1>
        <h3 class= "text1"> 1. There's no time restriction</h3> 
        <img class="img1" src="https://skills4lifeot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2.1.2020-S4L-Time-Mgmt-Blog-1080x675.png" alt="Time">
        <p class= "text2"> Studying online means there's so much flexibility isn the time you can spend to study. No matter what time of the day it is, you can arrange your time and decide to study according to your timetable. If you don't feel like studying, you can decide to laze around and relax, or you can do something you love to do without having to stick to a fixed schedule.</p> <br>
        <p class= "text2">
            This studying style will excel the most and is most suitable for the independent ones, the ones having the ability to plan thoroughly their timetable and their schedules.
        </p>
        <h3 class= "text1"> 2. You can study at your own pace </h3>

        <p class= "text2">
            When having to come physically into the classes at your school, quite often the time you are constantly being put under the pressure of having to understand what your lecturers/ teachers are saying as fast as possible. In addition to that, the teacher/lecturer may put you on the spot with questions you have to answer immediately. Well, with online studying, this is no longer the case since you have the time to absorb the lesson more properly.
        </p>
        <p class="text2">
            Well, lets say, you haven't quite grasped the concept of something you learn in programing. Here you go, short and sweet :))) And the best part is, you can rewatch it as many times as you would like !

            3. You can study from anywhere 
        </h3>

        <p class= "text2">
            Well you no longer have to worry about where you have to study. If you feel like going to a coffee store, a library, then go for it. Maybe the environment of the school doesn't fit you that much. Maybe the chilling and relaxing elements and a fresh air are what you are seeking, to optimize your studying process.
        </p>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <p class= "text2"> And for sure, choosing to study at home saves you a lot of time traveling to school , saves you the fuel cost and many things else!</p>

                4. You don't have to prepare for too many materials, and assignment can be done with a computer

            <p class="text2">
                With the formal education method, you have to prepare for the studying materials, unless you want to be scolded by the teacher!
                Also, anything related to coursework usually can be done completely online with the computer by your side.

               This is one of the fatal weakpoints of studying online. Without internet access, that would literally amount to no studying at all. Same goes for the case that you don't have a proper laptop, computer or smartphone.
            So obviously, online courses are far more popular in the urban areas compared to the remote areas .

               2. Low interaction level 
           </h3>

               Many a times you will find yourself kinda lonely and helpless if you stick to online courses. You will have to figure everything you still haven't understood by yourself. You can only have the sense of interaction and the atmostphere of discussion genuinely when you attend the physical classes. And most of us would find that need to talk to a friend nearby , to talk to him whether it is about the lesson or is about many other stuffs.

           <h3 class="text1"> 3.Some online studying platforms require students/learners to pay periodically </h3>

           <p class="text2">
               Google meet is one of the most typical examples for this. Learners are either required a license code or are required to pay an amount of money to use their service.
